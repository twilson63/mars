# Mars 

### What is it?

Is a simple web framework "JUST FOR FUN", built using Sinatra, Ruby, and ERB.

To quickly create web sites or applications...

Simply type: 
 
   mars {your project name}


To run a mars app:

    cd into your project folder and type:
    
    mars
    
## Install

    gem install mars


## Create a mercury project

    # Create a new folder for your project
    
    mars {project}
    

## Create a layout and index page

    cd {project}
  
===Run Server
    
    # cd back to the root directory
    
    cd ..
    
    # run 
    
    mars
    
    # now navigate to localhost:9292
            
    
== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
